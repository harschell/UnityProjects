Tips:

-  When making Sala move, it looks effective to alter his swimming animation speed in relation to his velocity.

-  To achieve the cell shaded effect as seen in the preview images, go to "Assets > Import Pakage > Toon Shading", and select the newly imported "Toon/Basic Outline" shader on the 2 provided Materials.
